    <h1>Happy Birthday ‚ù§Ô∏è</h1>
    <div class="letter">
      <p>Dear emily,</p>
      <p>
        Happy birthday emi! I‚Äôm so glad we‚Äôre able to celebrate your birthday in person, finally! I remember how sad I was when I wasn‚Äôt able to be there in person last year. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This year, your birthday gift is for both of us! Being able to explore China with you is something I‚Äôve always wanted to do, as I think this is the first country we‚Äôve ever explored together! But obviously, more to come. I‚Äôm thinking next stop is New Zealand. I‚Äôm so excited to explore Guangzhou and Hong Kong and soak in all the rich and unique culture there. I‚Äôm so excited for the conversations we‚Äôll have about what landmark we thought was the coolest, what dish we liked the most. I wouldn‚Äôt want to explore this country with anyone else but you.
      </p>
      <p>
        It‚Äôs been a rollercoaster of a year for the both of us. Last year around this time, we were newly minted WashU alumni. I was off in Japan with Ethan and Julian on our senior trip, one of the last adventures I would embark with them for a while. You were busy submitting job applications and tidying up your resume, all while reminiscing about the sweet college memories you made. 
      </p>
      <p>
        At that time, you were extremely stressed about not being able to land a job right out of college, and you had a lot of doubt in your abilities. In the next 3 months, you would go through hardships and job interviews that would knock you to the lowest of lows. But emily, you never gave up. You kept on trying and trying and trying again. I remember most vividly when you had told me teary eyed that you didn‚Äôt land the job after a seemingly successful final round interview. I was devastated for you as I was invested too! But you immediately started drafting up an email to the recruiting officer asking for constructive criticism. Your determination and passion for self reflection and improvement even at your lowest is a mindset I am truly inspired by. From my eyes, you developed so much perseverance and mental fortitude during the half year you were job searching. Being able to feel your struggles and experience these highs and lows with you also made me fall deeper and deeper in love with you. 
      </p>
      <p>
        However, with grit and determination, you would finally land a job at Veeva. I was ecstatic for you! I remember when you told me you got the Veeva offer, I was taking a walk.  I felt your joy, your relief, your happiness coursing through my veins. I probably looked like a doofus to spectators when I suddenly started prancing, jumping and screaming with joy at the same time. It was as if I got the job myself! To love you is to soar through the highs with our arms raised tall, and to embrace the lows holding each other‚Äôs hands. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Now‚Äôs the sappy part.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the past year, I believe I‚Äôve had several definitions of love. When I uttered those words a month after we started dating, I thought love was a giddy burst of affection that I don‚Äôt feel towards anyone else. When I uttered those words during our six month anniversary, I thought that love was seeing each other for who we are as a whole, and accepting each other with full arms. When I uttered those words during our one year anniversary picnic, I thought love was a deep, fulfilling desire to protect and care for someone. Now, I realize it‚Äôs a culmination of these definitions, with each definition making me fall deeper and deeper into stage 3 sleep :D I‚Äôm excited to see how this definition will change in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you emily, for allowing me the chance to love someone so deeply and tenderly. Thank you emily, for always being there to listen to me, even if it may pertain badly to you. Thank you emily, for allowing me to be your safe haven. Thank you emily, for supporting me in my endeavors on becoming a healthier and better human being. I love you!
      </p>
      <p>Love,elvi</p>
