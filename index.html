      <p>Dear [Name],</p>
      <p>
        From the very first moment we met, you've filled my life with joy, warmth, and laughter.
        On your special day, I wanted to do something different—something meaningful.
      </p>
      <p>
        This letter is more than just words—it's a celebration of everything you are: kind, strong, funny,
        thoughtful, and endlessly inspiring.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every little moment with you is a memory I treasure. From late-night talks to quiet mornings, from
        spontaneous adventures to shared dreams—thank you for being you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep being the amazing person you are. Here's a small gift from me—crafted with love and code ❤️
      </p>
      <p>With all my love,<br/>Elvin</p>
